# Comprehensive Literature Review: Microplastic Exposure Reduction in San Francisco

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive literature review examines the current state of knowledge regarding microplastic pollution and exposure reduction strategies, with specific focus on urban environments and the San Francisco Bay Area. Our systematic analysis of 25+ peer-reviewed studies from leading journals and research institutions reveals critical gaps in current understanding and identifies promising intervention strategies at multiple scales.

## 1. Defining the Problem: Microplastic Contamination in Urban Systems

### 1.1 Scope and Magnitude

Microplastics (particles <5mm) have emerged as one of the most pervasive environmental contaminants of the 21st century. In San Francisco Bay specifically, research by the San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI) has documented microplastic concentrations reaching **700,000 particles/km²** in surface watersamong the highest levels measured globally in urban waterbodies (Sutton et al., 2016).

### 1.2 San Francisco Bay: A Critical Case Study

The San Francisco Bay system serves as a crucial case study for understanding microplastic dynamics in urban estuaries. Key findings from SFEI research include:

- **Contamination Levels**: Bay surface waters show consistently higher microplastic concentrations than other North American urban waterbodies
- **Fish Ingestion**: At least 38% of Bay fish have consumed microplastics, indicating widespread food web contamination
- **Source Diversity**: Multiple pathways contribute contamination, including wastewater treatment plant discharge, stormwater runoff, and atmospheric deposition

## 2. Theoretical Frameworks and Conceptual Models

### 2.1 Source-Pathway-Receptor Model

Current research employs a source-pathway-receptor framework to understand microplastic contamination:

**Primary Sources:**
- Textile laundering (synthetic fiber release)
- Tire and road wear particles (TRWP)
- Personal care products and cosmetics
- Plastic waste degradation
- Industrial emissions

**Transport Pathways:**
- Wastewater treatment systems
- Urban stormwater runoff
- Atmospheric deposition and transport
- Direct littering and waste mismanagement

**Environmental Receptors:**
- Marine and freshwater ecosystems
- Terrestrial environments
- Food webs and human populations

### 2.2 Multi-Scale Intervention Framework

Emerging literature suggests a hierarchical intervention approach:

1. **Source Reduction**: Preventing generation at origin
2. **Pathway Interception**: Capturing particles during transport
3. **Environmental Remediation**: Removing particles from ecosystems
4. **Policy and Behavioral Change**: Systemic transformation

## 3. Major Research Findings by Intervention Category

### 3.1 Wastewater Treatment and Textile-Based Solutions

**Key Insight**: Textile laundering represents the single largest source of microplastic release to aquatic systems, accounting for up to 35% of total environmental emissions.

**Technological Solutions:**
- **Membrane Filtration**: Recent studies demonstrate >90% removal efficiency for microfibers >50¼m using coagulation-membrane hybrid systems (Luu et al., 2025)
- **Innovative Filters**: CLEANR's VORTX technology, inspired by manta ray feeding mechanisms, achieves >90% capture efficiency validated by Shaw Institute testing
- **Treatment Plant Upgrades**: Contrary to assumptions, tertiary filtration does not show superior microplastic removal compared to secondary treatment (Sutton et al., 2016)

**Research Gaps**: Limited data on long-term filter performance, disposal methods for captured particles, and cost-effectiveness across different scales.

### 3.2 Urban Stormwater and Green Infrastructure

**Key Insight**: Urban stormwater runoff can contain microplastic concentrations 6× higher than wastewater treatment plant effluent, making it a critical intervention target.

**Green Infrastructure Performance:**
- **Bioretention Systems**: 80-99% removal efficiency, particularly effective for particles e20¼m
- **Constructed Wetlands**: 28-75% removal rates, optimized for 100-500¼m particle range
- **Permeable Pavements**: 89-96.6% efficiency for particles <100¼m
- **Retention Ponds**: 55-98% retention, with sediment capture reaching 85%

**Mechanisms**: Performance depends on soil amendments, vegetation selection, hydraulic residence time, and particle size distribution.

### 3.3 Tire Wear Particles (TRWP) - An Emerging Priority

**Key Insight**: Tire wear particles represent a significant and understudied component of urban microplastic pollution, with direct links to aquatic toxicity.

**Critical Findings:**
- TRWP can comprise substantial fractions of stormwater microplastics
- 6PPD-quinone, a tire rubber-derived chemical, causes acute mortality in coho salmon
- Atmospheric transport enables long-distance TRWP dispersal
- Traditional stormwater management systems show variable TRWP capture efficiency

**Policy Response**: EPA's Trash Free Waters program has identified TRWP as priority research area, convening stakeholder roundtables to develop intervention strategies.

### 3.4 Health Impacts and Risk Assessment

**Key Insight**: While microplastics are now detected in human blood, organs, and placental tissue, comprehensive risk assessment frameworks remain underdeveloped.

**Established Health Concerns:**
- **Physical Effects**: Inflammatory responses, cellular damage, organ dysfunction
- **Chemical Toxicity**: Plastic additives and adsorbed contaminants
- **Systemic Distribution**: Translocation across biological barriers
- **Bioaccumulation**: Potential for long-term tissue accumulation

**Knowledge Gaps**: Dose-response relationships, chronic exposure effects, vulnerable population impacts, and standardized measurement methods.

## 4. Policy and Regulatory Responses
