# Data

## Overview

The Data section encompasses the comprehensive collection, organization, and analysis of datasets essential for researching microplastic exposure reduction in San Francisco. This multi-dimensional approach integrates environmental monitoring, demographic profiling, and behavioral assessment to enable personalized exposure mitigation strategies.

## Data Architecture

### Hyperlocal Environmental Monitoring
**Primary Datasets:**
- **San Francisco Bay Microplastic Data** (1.5 MB, Excel): Comprehensive microparticle measurements from surface water, sediment, stormwater, treated wastewater, and fish samples across SF Bay and adjacent National Marine Sanctuaries
- **EPA Air Quality Monitoring** (9.5 MB, CSV): Daily PM2.5 measurements from nationwide EPA monitoring stations, filtered for California/Bay Area coverage
- **Environmental Sensor Network**: Framework for deploying low-cost air and water sampling devices across 50+ SF locations with citizen participation

### Demographic and Socioeconomic Profiling  
**Primary Datasets:**
- **San Francisco Demographics** (21 MB, CSV): Population and demographic census data by neighborhood/tract including population density, income, education, housing, and transportation patterns
- **Behavioral Survey Data**: Individual activity patterns, consumption behaviors, and daily mobility profiles for exposure pathway quantification

### Spatial Resolution Framework
- **Neighborhood-level**: Analysis neighborhoods for citywide patterns
- **Census tract**: Detailed socioeconomic and demographic variables  
- **Block group**: Hyperlocal environmental and exposure modeling
- **Individual**: Personal exposure tracking via smartphone app integration

## Research Applications

### 1. Hyperlocal Source Mapping
**Objective**: Map microplastic sources and transport pathways across SF's urban microenvironment

**Data Integration**:
```python
# Combine environmental monitoring with spatial analysis
microplastic_sources = integrate_datasets(
    sf_bay_data,      # Baseline contamination levels
    air_quality_data, # Atmospheric transport pathways  
    spatial_models    # Source-receptor relationships
)
```

**Output**: High-resolution spatial maps of microplastic concentrations and primary sources by neighborhood

### 2. Individual Exposure Assessment
**Objective**: Quantify personal microplastic exposure based on location, behavior, and environmental conditions

**Methodology**:
- **Location-based**: Residential address mapped to environmental contamination levels
- **Activity-based**: Daily movement patterns and microenvironment exposure
- **Consumption-based**: Food, water, and product usage patterns affecting intake

**Exposure Model**:
```
Personal_Exposure = f(
    residential_location,    # Baseline environmental contamination
    activity_patterns,       # Time-activity in different microenvironments
    consumption_behaviors,   # Diet, water source, product usage
    demographic_factors      # Age, health status, lifestyle
)
```

### 3. Intervention Strategy Development
**Objective**: Design personalized behavioral interventions targeting highest-impact exposure pathways

**Data-Driven Approach**:
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict exposure reduction from specific behavioral changes
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare intervention effectiveness across demographic groups
- **Longitudinal Tracking**: Monitor exposure changes over time with sustained interventions
